To freeze unbaked cookie dough, start by rolling your dough into even balls (or use a cookie scoop) and place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Freeze in single layer for at least 30 minutes, or until the dough balls are frozen.
Transfer frozen dough balls to a freezer safe bag or airtight container and freeze for up to 2 months.
Bake cookies straight from freezer for about 2 minutes longer than normal.
